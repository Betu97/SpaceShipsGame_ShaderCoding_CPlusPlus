GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS

The game is based on avoiding an attack on the frigate.
Two enemies will try to destroy the frigate and you must try to avoid them.
Only by destroying one of the two you will be able to avoid the attack since there must be two to activate a bomb they have.
If you hit the frigate you will lose and the enemy attack will destroy you.
To defeat the enemies you must crash into one of the two (your ship is piloted remotely).


EXPLANATION OF THE CONTENT

A dynamic camera has been created with the WASD keys with a ship that is always in front of the camera (simulating to be your ship).
It is in constant movement, the ship never stops.
There are two enemy ships and one big friendly ship. All ships have a collisionbox with which the collision with is is controlled.
Three different ships have been created, the frigate, the interceptor and the fighter.
The environment moves in relation to the character and is also rendered first so that the other objects always overlap.
Ships move using a series of waypoints as they rotate close to the frigate.
When you win or lose, a log message appears reporting the result of the game and the game closes after the user clicks "ok".
